| Criteria                                | Description                                                  | Points |
| :-------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **Description of the entities**         | The identified identities are thought of from the perspective final user,  but a good design will take the internal view, for instance. The design must take into account the airplanes. The seat position on the plane determines the ticket fare. Some flights aren't direct, and some have some stops before the final arrival. There is a mix of information about the order (ticket) and the transaction on the Order's Identity. This means that the transaction is an entity on its own. But, the described entities and their relationship from the selected perspective are fully described. | 2      |
| **High-Level Over. Functions and case** | As we already said, a high-level overview is provided, but it is incomplete because of the chosen point of view (final user). There are more functions: register flights, airplanes, crew,  new trajectories, cancelation flights, etc. | 4      |
| **ER diagram**                          | ER Diagram is complete from the point of view choosen.       | 8      |
