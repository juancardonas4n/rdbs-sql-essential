| Criteria                                    | Description                                                  | Points |

| **Description of the entities**             | Usually, a movie has a primary genre, essential to classify the film but not sell tickets. This can be part of the movie's description. There is not necessary to have such a relationship between the genres. The Schedule entity is not described; instead, another entity is introduced MovieScheduler. The Rooms (MovieRooms could be renamed with CinemaRooms or simply Rooms) are described here but are ignored in the High-Level Functions and Use Cases. Usually, a particular seat in a Room determines the ticket price; it is the same as buying a ticket at the front of the room at the end of the room. | 2      |
| **High-Level Over. Functions and use case** | There is a description of almost all the functions needed to manage the project. It is not clear the context, the cinema has movies, but where do the movies will be projected? There are no different rooms, there are no seats, and searching for a seat is necessary. Also, the rating of the movie imposes some checking before the client enters the room, the clerk can not sell tickets to children when the movie is rate R. | 4      |
| **ER diagram**                              | The ER Diagram describes precisely the entities defined.     | 8      |
